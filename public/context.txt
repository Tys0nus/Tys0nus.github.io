Throughout his academic journey, Aditya has engaged in numerous significant projects. One of his notable projects involved designing a teleoperated Quadruped Spider robot equipped with 8 degrees of freedom, 4 arms, and integrated camera and LiDAR sensors, which he simulated in Gazebo to emulate inverse kinematics. This project required a deep understanding of robotic kinematics and control, as well as proficiency in ROS and Gazebo for simulation. Another project included developing a muscle-reflex-driven exoskeleton control system to assist individuals with spinal cord injuries, focusing on enhancing gait stability through neuromuscular control. This project involved using OpenSim for biomechanical analysis and Python for control system development. Aditya also conducted an ablation study to evaluate the impact of various design choices on human trajectory prediction accuracy in social environments using a multi-module LSTM network. This project showcased his ability to apply deep learning techniques to real-world problems, analyzing the effect of input embeddings such as position, relative velocity, and pose keypoints on prediction accuracy.

In addition to these projects, Aditya developed a Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) path planning algorithm for a 3D neurosurgical environment, addressing the challenges of navigating steerable bevel-tipped needles with non-holonomic constraints. This project highlighted his ability to develop innovative solutions for complex, high-stakes applications. He also explored imitation learning for drone filming, using an LSTM network to capture realistic and dynamic aerial motion videos. This project involved studying input embeddings from video frames and pose embeddings, demonstrating his versatility in applying machine learning techniques to diverse applications. Furthermore, Aditya created a high-fidelity simulation for vertical rocket landing, optimizing the guidance algorithm via Monte Carlo simulations to achieve landing precision within 10 meters under varied conditions. This project required a deep understanding of control systems and simulation techniques. He also designed output feedback controllers (LQR and LQG) for a dual pendulum cart system, analyzing controllability and observability, and ensuring stability through Lyapunov stability criterion. Additionally, he developed a localization system for Turtlebot3 using ROS2 and Gazebo, implementing a closed-loop PID control system to navigate the robot to a custom goal.

Professionally, Aditya has gained valuable experience through various roles. As a Robotics Engineer Intern at Kick Robotics, he validated a custom software package for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation, leading to a 20% improvement in navigation accuracy. This role involved testing and refining algorithms, ensuring their robustness and reliability for real-world deployment. He also served as an Air Brakes Controls Engineer for Terrapin Rockets, developing a custom controller design for a high-powered rocket’s air brake system aimed at achieving a target apogee of 10,000 feet. In this role, he simulated feature parameters, fine-tuned controller performance, and integrated sensors using a multivariate Kalman Filter, contributing to the team’s flight software development.

As the Lead of the Virtual Dynamics Event Division for BAJA SAEINDIA, Aditya conducted IPG CarMaker training sessions for over 1,000 engineering students across the country, helping them develop a digital-twin all-terrain BAJA buggy. He introduced and administered validation events for 170 student teams, ensuring the virtual vehicle’s fidelity with physical performance through real-time simulator setups. In these roles, he conducted training sessions, administered validation events, led team reviews, directed budgets, and regulated administrative functions.
